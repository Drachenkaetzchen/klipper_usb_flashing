# 120 ohm Termination Resistor

As the Spider v1.0 requires an [external CAN transciever](#transceiver) there is no built in 120ohm resistor on the Spider itself. The transceiver you use will likely have the 120r resistor hard soldered already, but some may have jumpers or solder pads to add/remove it from the circuit.
